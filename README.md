### How are graceful degradation and service workers related?

Graceful degradation and service workers are related as they are both strategies for improving/bettering the user experience when environments are less than perfect or maintainable. Graceful degradation is the concept of building a web application with full features for the most newest version of web browsers while also making sure that these features work on browsers that are not as updated or new. Service workers help this concept by acting as a layer between the browser and the network, enabling features like offline access and caching as we saw we tested in the lab.
